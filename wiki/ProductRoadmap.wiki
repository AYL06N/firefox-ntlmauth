= Introduction =

This is a pretty simple add-on, but I'm kinda new to Firefox add-ons so it's good to have a plan. Now that it's out there, some additional things I'd like to get in:

= Integration with Auth Dialog =

I want to integrate with the authentication dialog so when you access an NTLM-enabled site and the username/password dialog pops up, an additional button will appear that says "Use NTLM Auth" or something.

This is going to require figuring out [https://developer.mozilla.org/en/How_to_Build_an_XPCOM_Component_in_Javascript how to write XPCOM in JavaScript] because I need to have a window event watcher that catches the dialog popping up and also checks the corresponding request to see if it's NTLM-aware.
